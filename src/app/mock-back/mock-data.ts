        description: 'The issues view is split in two sections, the actual issue and the sidebar.\r\nOn the issues section there is everything centered around the issues actual context. The sidebar is mostly used to switch between the issue queries and has no relation to the issue itself. Except for the watchers list, which is separated from every other context on this view. This looks very odd to new users and it makes it hard to scan over the issue quickly. You always miss the watchers list.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose to place it besides the rest of the issues information as this is the place I would look first for it.\r\nYou have all issue related information in one place. Additionally the watchers list is no longer hidden in the sidebar menu if you are using Redmine on mobile devices.\r\n\r\n!watchers_list_in_issue_section.png!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

        description: 'I have the problem, that the autocomplete feature is not working when selecting other issues. This happens e.g. when I want to add an association to another issue or put something into the parent issue field.\r\n\r\n*Expected/old behavior:*\r\nI know that recently I could simply type 2-3 letters of the topic name and using a background call to the server all issues with this string were searched. I could click one and I get the corresponding issue number inserted automatically.\r\n\r\n*Actual behavior:*\r\nFor a short time a waiting GIF (turning circle) is shown, when sufficiently many letters are typed in. Instead of a box with the possible values nothing is shown. So all I can do is to put the number of the issue to be referenced manually.\r\n\r\nWhen looking deeper into the problem I find that the browser starts a connection to the server using ajax and gets a JSON object with the correct result of the search. It seems that this result is simply not made visible.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I am not familiar enough with the JS code of redmine to track this down completely. It might as well be a CSS issue that the "box" is simply hidden/overdrawn.\r\n\r\nIf needed I can give access to the server with an account to see the effect in a sandbox.

        description: 'Redmine *squanders* the capabilities of CodeRay for previewing code files in Redmine\'s preview pane. A very prominent squandering is the negligence of *javascript* files, for which Redmine only shows that no preview is available.\r\n\r\nAttachmentsController#show method only tests: @attachment.is_text? - The function Attachment::is_text? only relies on Redmine::MimeType.is_type?(\'text\', filename). The mime type of javascript, however, is "application/javascript". Here Redmine misses what CodeRay can do.\r\n\r\nI propose the following patches:\r\n\r\nAdd function \'is_code?\' to Attachment.rb\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\ndef is_code?\r\n  ::CodeRay::FileType[filename].present?\r\nend\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nPatch AttachmentsController.rb (Redmine 3.4.6)\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n- elsif @attachment.is_text? && @attachment.filesize <= Setting.file_max_size_displayed.to_i.kilobyte\r\n+ elsif (@attachment.is_text? || @atachments.is_code?) && @attachment.filesize <= Setting.file_max_size_displayed.to_i.kilobyte\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThese two patches add previews for cfc, cfm, clj, cpp, cu, cxx, c++, C, dpr, gemspec, go, groovy, gvy, haml, hpp, h++, html.erb, js, lua, mab, pas, phtml, prawn, py3, pyw, raydebug, rjs, rpdf, ru, rxml, sass, taskpaper, template, tmproj, xaml\r\n\r\nI have provided a plugin that applies these patches as a proof of concept:\r\n\r\n[[https://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_more_code]]\r\n\r\n',

After applying this patch, both expressions will be accepted.\r\n\r\nAccording to IDN World Report, there are "approx 8.7 millions":https://idnworldreport.eu/year-2017/facts-and-figures/idn-growth/ IDNs in the world as of December 2016, and those "are used in many countries":https://idnworldreport.eu/maps/idn-world-map/. To support IDN email addresses should be beneficial for many people.\r\n\r\nThis patch converts Unicode domain names to traditional ASCII domain names just before saving an email address. However, it does not convert ASCII domain names to Unicode domain names when displaying email address. Users will see ASCII expression "joe@xn--eckwd4c7cu47r2wf.jp" on my_account page even if they have entered Unicode email address "joe@„Éâ„É°„Ç§„É≥Âêç‰æã.jp".\r\n\r\nThis approach can minimize the change to existing code and works fine with IDN-unaware MTAs and plugins while allowing people to use IDN email addresses.\r\n\r\n*"Email" field accepts Unicode domain names:*\r\n!{border: 1px solid #ccc;}.idn-support-screenshot-1.png!\r\n\r\n*ASCII converted email address is shown after saving:*\r\n!{border: 1px solid #ccc;}.idn-support-screenshot-2.png!\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n* "IDN World Report ‚Äì Official World Report on Internationalised Domain Names":https://idnworldreport.eu/\r\n* "Punycoder - the Punycode converter &#40;IDN converter&#41;":https://www.punycoder.com/\r\n',

        description: 'When using custom fields with format *Long text*, the *Regular expression* does not fully validate the field, as it seems to not be working multiline and global.\r\n\r\nUsing our case as example for this issue:\r\n\r\nWe want to validate a field named *Steps to reproduce*. We use the following regex:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n(([1-9]+[0-9]*\\. [A-Z]+.*?(\\n|$))+)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nAnd the following field *Default value* as a template:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n1. Start the application\r\n2. \r\n. Observe the issue\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nThe template by itself without modification by the issue reporter should not validate. A valid example of a correct field would be:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n1. Start the application\r\n2. Go to "Help"\r\n3. Click "About"\r\n4. Observe the issue\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nHowever, Redmine only validates the first line of the field. If the first line line does not pass the regex test, Redmine correctly complains "Steps To Reproduce is invalid". But it does ignores everything in the following lines.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that could work by rewriting the regular expression.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Make all *Long text* custom fields regex global and multiline by default\r\n2. Add additional checkboxes in custom field edit page with *Multiline* and *Global* to complement the *Regular expression* field\r\n\r\n*Environments:*\r\n\r\nWe can confirm this issue in both our current production environment as well as our test environment (the version of which will be migrating our production environment soon).\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nProduction Environment:\r\n  Redmine version                3.2.1.stable\r\n  Ruby version                   2.3.4-p301 (2017-03-30) [x86_64-linux-gnu]\r\n  Rails version                  4.2.6\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               Mysql2\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nTest Enviroment:\r\nEnvironment:\r\n  Redmine version                3.4.2.stable\r\n  Ruby version                   2.3.4-p301 (2017-03-30) [x86_64-linux-gnu]\r\n  Rails version                  4.2.8\r\n  Environment                    production\r\n  Database adapter               Mysql2\r\n</pre>\r\n',

The Problem\r\n\r\nIn the response of an API call for an issue (<url>/1234.xml) with an custom field specified, i find a custom field element like this:\r\n<pre><code class="xml">\r\n<custom_field id="1" name="applied-to" multiple="true">\r\n  <value type="array">\r\n    <value>1</value>\r\n    <value>2</value>\r\n    <value>3</value>\r\n  </value>\r\n</custom_field>\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nSo the problem is, that i get back the values of the custom field, but not the labels for this values.\r\n\r\nWhen i visit the webpage for this issue, the labels of the values are displayed, so it is no permission issue.',

For example, people say "Maeda-san" when talking to me. You can see more examples even on this site, such as #28125#note-18, #27009#note-5, and #25775#note-4. There are various honorific suffixes in Japanese. The most commonly used one is "„Åï„Çì" ("san"). Many localized software use "„Åï„Çì" in Japanese messages.\r\n\r\nThe attached patch adds "„Åï„Çì" after "%{author}".\r\n\r\n!{width: 329px; border: 1px solid #ccc;}.screenshot-29151@2x.png!',

So, most Japanese people cannot understand the word "„Éà„É©„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº" without someone\'s explanation.\r\n\r\nI suggest changing "„Éà„É©„ÉÉ„Ç´„Éº" to "„ÉÅ„Ç±„ÉÉ„ÉàÁ®ÆÂà•" (means "issue type"). It is very clear and people can easily understand the use of trackers.',

        description: 'Since #19299 was implemented (I\'m assuming somewhat here), the sort order of projects in the dropdown list is sort-of-alfabetical.  If used to be in the same order as the project list, in other words, alfabetical, but with sub-project sorted under their parents. Now, in the dropdown list (right top corner), the list is sorted with parent projects first, then sub-project, and then sub-sub-projects, etc.\r\n\r\nThis does not make sense.  Why are sub-projects not sorted under their parents?  If we have parent projects like "Oranges", "Apples", "Pears" with sub-projects of Autumn, Spring and Summer under each, then there are 9 sub-projects listed "Autumn, Autumn, Autumn, Spring, Spring, Spring, Summer, Summer, Summer" for example.  I know it\'s possible to name sub-projects differently, but even with other naming, knowing which project a sub-projects belongs too it important and the list doens\'t show that, which makes it sort of pretty much worthless.',

This is bad for performance because it blocks the database.\r\nMy patch transforms the update query into a select query that doesn\'t block on heavy load. We could actually update the token only once per hour which is the minimum available setting for Setting.session_lifetime and Setting.session_timeout, but redmine modifications could use smaller values, so I choose 1 minute interval. Smaller session_timeout then 1 minute won\'t work now, but I think such small timeout doesn\'t make much sense.',

While editing and adding the issue\'s text, he notices an unwanted attachment in the issue head (in the yellow box on top of an issue) - so he clicks the small trash bin icon right to the attachment. The user gets asked if he is sure to delete this file, so he clicks "Yes". *Now all of his text changes are gone because Redmine reloads the issue page! And it doesn\'t even warn the user that all of his changes will get lost.*\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, I suggest a solution similar to when a user wants to close a browser tab while there is still an unsaved issue edit. Here the user gets asked if he really wants to close this tab.\r\n\r\nThe Redmine version is 3.4.5, and I also confirmed this with an older Redmine 2.6.2.',

        subject: 'Allow email to create and reply to forum messages',
        description: 'h2. Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a patch for #277 that provides the ability to send messages to forums via email.  This gives Redmine a mailing list like capability by utilizing the work done in #1110 (Allow email to create issue or add comment), which has been available since r1572.  By enabling this functionality users can create new and reply to existing forum messages that will be sent out via email to all those who are _watching_ that forum.  \r\n\r\nh2. Configuration\r\n\r\nThere are two areas of configuration for this feature.  One is how you get emails into Redmine and the other is an optional configuration to set a different _emission email address_ specifically for forum emails.  \r\n\r\nh3. Receiving Forum Message Emails for Redmine Processing\r\n\r\nIn order to receive emails into Redmine the documentation found [[RedmineReceivingEmails|here]] should be used.  This documentation covers specific settings for creating issues within Redmine.  The only issue attribute that applies to this patch is the project attribute.  If you set the project attribute.  I have done my functional testing using the IMAP setup.  The rake command looks something like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nrake redmine:email:receive_imap host=imap.domain.com port=XXX ssl=true username=username@domain.com password=password_here RAILS_ENV=_production_\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nUsing the IMAP setup, you must schedule the rake command to run on a regular basis using cron or another job scheduling mechanism.\r\n\r\nh3. Forum Emission Email Address\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a different _reply-to_ email address for forum messages than you use for other emails sent from Redmine, then you\'ll need to do the following:\r\n\r\n# Login to your Redmine instance as an Administrator\r\n# Click the _Administration_ link at the top of the page\r\n# Click on the _Settings_ link\r\n# Click on the _Email Notifications_ tab\r\n# Enter the email address for forum emails in the _Forum emission email address_ field\r\n#* This email address should go to the email account receiving forum emails (configured above in the _Receiving Forum Message Emails for Redmine Processing_ section)\r\n# Click the _Save_ button\r\n\r\nh2. User Documentation\r\n\r\nThe following describes how to make use of the email to forum functionality.\r\n\r\nh3. How to Create a New Forum Message via Email\r\n\r\nIn order to create a new forum message, you simply address an email to the email address specified in either the Adminitration->Settings->Email Notifications _Forum emission email address_ field (if populated) or the _Emission email address_ (if the the _Forum emission email address_ field is not populated).  The subject of the email should be in the format of: \r\n\r\n[Project Name - Forum Name] Forum message subject goes here\r\n\r\nThe format of the email body is not important.  The script that processes the forum emails is setup to determine the project and forum names based on the email subject.\r\n\r\nh3. How to Reply to a Forum Message via Email\r\n\r\nThis is pretty simple. When you receive an email of a forum message you simply reply to the message and write your reply in the body of the email.  One important thing to note is that you *SHOULD NOT* change the subject line if you want the email to be recognized as a reply to an existing forum message.  The script that processes the forum emails is setup to determine the original forum message being replied to by the portion of the subject that follows the square brackets.\r\n\r\nh3. Receive Forum Message Emails in Your Email Inbox\r\n\r\nIn case it\'s not clear how you receive forum messages, I\'m adding that info here.  The best way to subscribe to receive emails for a particular forum is to:\r\n\r\n# Click on the _Forums_ tab in Redmine\r\n# Click on the name of the forum you want to subscribe to\r\n# Click on the _Watch_ link so that the star icon turns yellow\r\n\r\nYou can also subscribe to all forums (and all other Redmine email notifications) by clicking on the _My account_ link in the upper right hand of the page and then select _For any event on all my projects_ from the drop down menu under the _Email notifications_ section.',

Assume for example that a user account has been hacked, and either the user or the administrator changes the user\'s password. Now the user/administrator might assume that the situation has been resolved, but in fact the user still has to manually reset his API key, because the attacker might have saved it. If the user doesn\'t do this (for example because he doesn\'t know about the API key at all), he now left his account open to API abuse by the attacker.\r\n\r\nMaybe the password dialog should display a note about this, or offer a check box that resets the API key?',

        description: 'Suppose you have a project P which has subprojects P1. Further you have a global, saved issue query with a @project_id@ filter for just the subproject P1.\r\n\r\nWhen calling that query in the context of P (by going to /projects/p/issues?query_id=123), only issues of P1 are shown. The same is true for the PDF export when accessed from this page. However, the CSV export when accessed from the same page, will contain issues from P as well.\r\n\r\nThe cause of that discrepancy is, that the modal CSV export options window serializes the query into a bunch of hidden fields, while the PDF export just uses the @query_id@ URL parameter, like the web UI view does.\r\n\r\nDeeper down, the problem is the timing of when @@query.project@ is set in @QueriesHelper#retrieve_query@: With @query_id@ present, the query is loaded and then the project is set. Without @query_id@ (in the CSV export case), the project is set first, before the params are applied. This results in a different available_filters configuration, because only in absence of the project, the @project_id@ filter will be added. So with the project being set early, the project_id filter isn\'t initialized in the query object and thus all issues of P are rendered in the CSV. I\'m attaching a failing test case illustrating the problem.\r\n\r\nI tried two approaches to solve the problem but both weren\'t really straightforward and I\'m not sure which one to pursue further.\r\n\r\n1. Use @query_id@ in the hidden fields of the modal instead of serializing all the filters. I changed the @query_as_hidden_field_tags@ helper for this, basing it\'s output on @Query#as_params@. That worked somewhat but at least the \'all columns\' option would need special treatment in this case because it was ignored.\r\n2. Change QueriesHelper#retrieve_query to not initialize the new query with the project when creating it, but apply the params first and set the project later. While this solved my case, it broke a lot of other test cases in both issues and timelog_reports controller tests.\r\n3. There might be a better way to fix this in @IssueQuery@ itself, by differentiating the cases of \'should I show the project filter in the UI\' (only if called outside project context) from \'should I apply an already set project filter\' (yes, if the projects filtered for are sub-projects of the present project).\r\n\r\nOpinions, anybody?\r\n\r\nThe problem is present at least since 3.3, I worked on current trunk (r17320).',

Function is declared @$.fn.datepickerFallback = function( options )@ [application.js:836] with one argument.
